        <h5>PROJECT BACKGROUND</h5>
        <p>The goal of this project is to design a single screen dashboard to show the critical effect of climate change and biodiversity on Sub-Saharan Africa. Therefore, as designers we must create a board to satisfy both our clients’ and user’s individual goals. The users will not be able to interact with the dashboard so the only way to reach the users by using animations to attract the user's attention.</p>

              <h6>CLIENTS: SCIENTISTS</h6>
              <p>Our client for this project is an advisory board of scientists who wanted to stress the important results of their research on climate change and biodiversity and the monitoring efforts that should be acted upon. Their primary goal is to urge the policy makers to take appropriate actions to mitigate the effect that climate change have on biodiversity before it’s too late.</p>

            <h6>USERS: POLICY MAKERS</h6>
            <p>Our users are national-level policy makers who are swamped with a lot of information and distraction. They do not have a lot of time to dedicate time to focus on the dashboard.</p>

        <h5>RESEARCH</h5>
        <p>
          We started out by doing online research to understand the effects of climate change on biodiversity. We tried to find different correlations and indicators of climate change and its affect on the land and the people. From there, we had to narrow down on what we wanted to show and point out to the policy makers with one single dashboard screen. 
          <br>
        </p><br>

        <h5>KEY FINDINGS</h5>
        <ul class = "dashed1">
          <li class ="dash"> Africa feels <strong> greater effects</strong> of climate change relative to first-world economies </li>
          <li class ="dash"> The population in Sub-Saharan Africa is projected to  <strong>reach more than 2 billion </strong> or 22% of the world total by 2050. </li>
          <li class ="dash"> Traditional or modern methods for production can’t keep up with <strong> changing environment</strong></li>
          <li class ="dash"> Currently, people are slashing and burning forested or heavily wooded area for <strong> short-term survival needs </strong></li>
          <li class ="dash"> Elephants’ roaming and eating habits are essential to the <strong>maintenance of the different habitats </strong> and thus to the survival of many species of plants and animals. </li>
          <li class ="dash"> Elephants are <strong> sensitive to climate change </strong>. </li>
            <li style="margin-left:3em; list-style-type: circle; margin-bottom: .5em"> They are heat-sensitive animals and get sunburnt so they are susceptible heat stress.</li>
            <li style="margin-left:3em; list-style-type: circle; margin-bottom: .5em">Their birth peaks correlate with rainfall peaks</li>
            <li style="margin-left:3em; list-style-type: circle; margin-bottom: .5em">Although elephants follow a typical yearly migration path, in the absence of sufficient water, they will deviate from their normal path in the hopes of finding other sources of water and more suitable habitats.</li>

          <h5> INITIAL DESIGNS</h5>
          <p> From the research we gathered, we sketched different ways to visualize all this data. We narrowed down somes indicators to focus on. Below are some of our sketches and drafts we made to see what kind of correlations we can make with the data we had:</p>

          </div>

          
          <h5>NEXT ITERATION </h5>
           <p> From our initial feedback we got, we realized that we lacked a central message. Therefore, for the next iteration, we picked 3 areas with high agricultural yield in profit and added a blowout on the map to show more information of the area.
          </p>

          <h5>FINAL DESIGN </h5>
           <p>
           For our final design, we made it easier for the users to quickly spot and get alerted about any unusual activities. The dashboard’s point of entry is a quick glance into past, present, and the predicted future of wheat production in relation to the region’s demand. The co-location of the rainfall trend over the same time period immediately show the the potential reasons for any decrease in the wheat production. Shifting his/her gaze to the map callouts, the policy maker is provided with real-time trend information about the region’s most important agricultural areas. Not only do these callouts present temperature changes that could affect the area’s crop productivity, they also highlight when these temperature changes cause deviations in elephant migration, which could also endanger the agricultural areas. Focusing on the map itself lends the third possible reason for wheat underproduction. The map presents converted agricultural land throughout the region encoded by how well each area is producing relative to its potential, i.e. what it could produce.

          <h5>FUTURE ACTION FOR POLICY MAKERS</h5>
          <ul class="dashed">
            <li style="margin-bottom: .5em;"> Use predictive climate information provided by the dashboard to take <strong>advanced precautions</strong> as to when these changes may have major effects on crop production </li>
       
            <li style="margin-bottom: .5em;"> Act on the provided knowledge of <strong>elephant migration deviations</strong> by notifying the farmers of the affected fields and encouraging these farmers to take advantage of simple, organic elephant repellents instead of attacking the elephant. </li>
          
             <li style="margin-bottom: .5em;"> Utilize the knowledge of where farmers are not using their land to produce to its potential to focus his promotion of more <strong>sustainable agricultural practices</strong> to target those areas.
          </li>
