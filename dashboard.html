        <h5>PROJECT BACKGROUND</h5>
        <p>
          The goal was to design a single screen dashboard to bring attention to climate change and biodiversity for Sub-Saharan Africa. However, the challenge is to create one dashboard that help merge both the client's desire and user needs even though both might have different objective.</p>

        <h5>RESEARCH</h5>
        <p>
          From our initial research, we realized Sub-Saharan Africa has a wide range of habits and ecosystem. There are a lot of species that are dependent on rainfall, temperture, and degree of topographical and habitat variation. Africa feels a greater effect of climate change relative to first-world economies. Climate changes poses a great threat to biodiversity and the growth in agriculture is linked to the growth of the population. In Sub-Saharan Africa's population is projected to reach <strong>more than 2 billions or 22% of the world total by 2050</strong>. By 2080, Sub-Saharan Africa will be the only region in the world with a population that is still growing. This will affect the food production because the traditional or modern methods for production can’t keep up with changing environment. Currently, they are slashing and burning forested or heavily wooded area for short-term survival needs. But the exploited local ecosystem and natural rate of replenishment which decreases diversity. Therefore, as the population continues to grow, the biodiversity of the area decreases.
        </p> 
<!--         <p>
          Our clients are scientists who are concerned about biodiversity in Sub-Saharan Africa. Their research shows that African elephants play a big role in the preservation of biodiversity in Sub-Saharan Africa. The elephants’ roaming and eating habits are essential to the maintenance of the different habitats and thus to the survival of many species of plants and animals. However, elephants are sensitive to climate change. They are heat-sensitive animals, so they are susceptible heat stress. An increase of 1 or 2 degrees in temperature can also cause the elephants to be sunburnt. Elephants are also sensitive to other environmental changes. Their birth peaks correlate with rainfall peaks. Further, they require a lot of freshwater to drink and bathe in. As such, although elephants follow a typical yearly migration path, in the absence of sufficient water, they will deviate from their normal path in the hopes of finding other sources of water and more suitable habitats.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our users are policymakers in Sub-Saharan Africa who are focused on the agricultural development of the region but who may not necessarily consider how their policies may affect, or be impacted by, the region’s biodiversity. Their interest in agriculture is twofold. For one, agriculture makes up about 42% of the Sub-Saharan Africa’s income ( Source ) and therefore its sustainment is important for the region’s economy. The policymakers thus want to focus on those areas with high profit yields that will help increase GDP. Secondly, the region’s human inhabitants suffer severely from hunger. As such, better crop production is also crucial because of its potential to help reduce these problematic hunger rates. Although agricultural development is widespread in the region, crop production is still not meeting demand. Therefore, these policymakers are mainly concerned with increasing crop production, perhaps by better utilizing current agricultural land.

<!--         <h5>KEY INDICATORS</h5>
        <ul>
          <li> - Climate Change </li> <p> This will be measured by the temperature change. Climate change has resulted in increased variability and intensity of drought and floods, higher temperatures, loss of  biodiversity  and increased incidents of pests and  diseases.</p>

          <li> - Agriculture Growth </li> <p> Majority of poor are dependent on agriculture with 85% deriving at least a part of their livelihood from the sector</p>

          <li> - Rainfall </li> <p> This can be measured by the population number and the rate of urbanization.</p>

          <li> - Population Growth </li> <p> This can be measured by the number of rainfall by year and the frequency of droughts.</p>

          <li> - Biodiversity Measure </li> <p> This can be measured by species richness on how diverse each area is.</p>

          <li> - Keystone species </li> <p> Keystone species are key species that are sensitive to the changes in the climate. This includes the butterflies, Savannah elephants, Tsetse flies, African palm flora, and others. </p>

          <li> - Habitat Loss/Deforestation </li> <p> This can be measured by the amount of forest per square feet and the rate of deforestation. </p>

          <li> - Poaching </li> <p> KWildlife trafficking doesn’t affect the security of just one habitat or one species  —  it affects the security of us all. </p>
        </ul> -->
        <br>
        <h5> INITIAL DESIGNS</h5>
        <p> From the research we gathered, we sketched different ways to visualize all this data. We narrowed down to 6 indicators to focus on. These include the temperature change to track the climate change, agricutlure growth measured through wheat (one of the largest crop), rainfall, population growth, the elephant population, and poaching.

        <img class = "dashboardImg" src="img/portfolio/dashboard_Draft3.png">
 

        <p>
        From our initial feedback, we had a lot of useful information but we lacked a central message. 
        </p> <br>

        <br>

        <p>
        The dashboard’s point of entry is a quick glance into past, present, and predicted future wheat production in relation to the region’s demand. The co-location of the rainfall trend over the same time period immediately correlates for the policymaker one of the three potential reasons for any wheat underproduction. Shifting his/her gaze to the map callouts, the policymaker is provided with real-time and trend information about 3 of the region’s most important agricultural areas. Not only do these callouts present temperature changes that could affect the area’s crop productivity, they also highlight when these temperature changes cause deviations in elephant migration which could also endanger the agricultural areas. Focusing on the map itself lends the third possible reason for wheat underproduction. The map presents converted agricultural land throughout the region encoded by how well each area is producing relative to its potential, i.e. what it could produce.
       </p><br>
       
        <h5>KEY INDICATORS</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>1. Agricultural fields and how well they produce relative to the land’s potential. </li>
            <li>2. Wheat (a staple crop in the region) production in relation to demand </li>
            <li>3. Keystone Species - Elephant. Their migration patterns and the deviations from these norms due to climate change </li>
            <li>4. Temperature in key agricultural regions</li>
            <li>5. Rainfall in relation to wheat production</li>
          </ul>
        <br>

        <h5>ACTION FOR POLICYMAKERS</h5>
          <P>
            - Use predictive climate information provided by the dashboard to take advanced precautions as to when these changes may have major effects on crop production 
            <br>
            - Act on the provided knowledge of elephant migration deviations by notifying the farmers of the affected fields and encouraging these farmers to take advantage of simple, organic elephant repellents instead of attacking the elephant. 
            <br>
            - Utilize the knowledge of where farmers are not using their land to produce to its potential to focus his promotion of more sustainable agricultural practices to target those areas.
