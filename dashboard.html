        <h5>PROJECT BACKGROUND</h5>
        <p>Our client for this project was an advisory board of scientists who wanted to see the fruits of their research and monitoring efforts acted upon. The users of the dashboard were national-level policy makers. Secondary and tertiary audiences included NGOs, non-profits, and the public. Our goal was to create a dashboard that expressed the impact that climate change was having on biodiversity for the Sub-Saharan. It should provide policy makers with the information they need to act in terms of modifying current policy or enacting new policy. The users would not be able to interact with the dashboard. Therefore, the only way to alert and grab the user's attention was by using animations.</p>

        <h5>RESEARCH</h5>
        <p>
          We started out by doing online research to understand the effects of climate change on biodiversity. We tried to find different correlations and indicators of climate change and its effects on the land and the people.           <br>
        </p><br>

        <h5>KEY FINDINGS</h5>
        <ul class = "dashed1">
          <li class ="dash"> Africa feels <strong> greater effects</strong> of climate change relative to first-world economies </li>
          <li class ="dash"> The population in Sub-Saharan Africa is projected to  <strong>reach more than 2 billion </strong> or 22% of the world total by 2050 </li>
          <li class ="dash"> Traditional or modern methods for production can’t keep up with <strong> changing environment</strong></li>
          <li class ="dash"> Currently, people are slashing and burning forested or heavily wooded area for <strong> short-term survival needs </strong></li>
          <li class ="dash"> Elephants’ roaming and eating habits are essential to the <strong>maintenance of the different habitats </strong> and thus to the survival of many species of plants and animals </li>
          <li class ="dash"> Elephants are <strong> sensitive to climate change</strong> </li>
            <li style="margin-left:3em; list-style-type: circle; margin-bottom: .5em"> They are heat-sensitive animals and get sunburnt so they are susceptible heat stress</li>
            <li style="margin-left:3em; list-style-type: circle; margin-bottom: .5em">Their birth peaks correlate with rainfall peaks</li>
            <li style="margin-left:3em; list-style-type: circle; margin-bottom: .5em">Although elephants follow a typical yearly migration path, in the absence of sufficient water, they will deviate from their normal path in the hopes of finding other sources of water and more suitable habitats</li>

          </div>

          <h5>KEY INDICATORS</h5>
          <p> After consolidating all of our findings, we narrowed it down to 5 key indicators that we would add to our one single dashboard screen. We selected these indicators because they were correlated with each other in some way. When these data points were aggregated together, it could tell a story. It would indicate when it was a critical point for the policy makers to act before it reached the point of no return.</p>

          <ul style="list-style-type: decimal">
            <li> The agricultural fields and their produce level </li>
            <li> Wheat (a staple crop in the region) production </li>
            <li> Keystone Species - Elephant Migration Pattern </li>
            <li> Temperature in key agricultural regions</li>
            <li> Rainfall in relation to wheat production</li>
          </ul>

          </div>

          <h5> INITIAL DESIGNS</h5>
          <p> From the research we gathered, we sketched different ways to visualize all this data. Below are some of our sketches and drafts we made to see how we can show the correlations with the data we had:</p>

            </div>
          </div>

          
          <h5>NEXT ITERATION </h5>
           <p> From our initial feedback we got, we realized that we lacked a central message. Therefore, for the next iteration, we picked 3 areas with high agricultural yield in profit which were elephant’s migration patterns, temperature, and rainfall. We added a blowout on the map to highlight these areas.

          </p>

          <br><br>

          <h5>FINAL DESIGN </h5>
           <p>
           For our final design, we made it easier for the users to quickly spot and get alerted about any unusual activities. The dashboard’s point of entry was a quick glance into past, present, and the predicted future of wheat production in relation to the region’s demand. The co-location of the rainfall trend over the same time period immediately showed the the potential reasons for any decrease in the wheat production. Shifting his/her gaze to the map callouts, the policy maker was provided with real-time trend information about the region’s most important agricultural areas. Not only do these callouts presented temperature changes that could affect the area’s crop productivity, they also highlighted when these temperature changes caused the deviations in elephant migration, which could also endanger the agricultural areas. Focusing on the map itself lend the third possible reason for wheat underproduction. The map presented converted agricultural land throughout the region encoded by how well each area was producing relative to its potential, i.e. what it could produce.

          <h5>FUTURE ACTION FOR POLICY MAKERS</h5>
          <ul class="dashed">
            <li style="margin-bottom: .5em;"> Use predictive climate information provided by the dashboard to take <strong>advanced precautions</strong> as to when these changes may have major effects on crop production </li>
       
            <li style="margin-bottom: .5em;"> Act on the provided knowledge of <strong>elephant migration deviations</strong> by notifying the farmers of the affected fields and encouraging these farmers to take advantage of simple, organic elephant repellents instead of attacking the elephants </li>
          
             <li style="margin-bottom: .5em;"> Utilize the knowledge of where farmers are not using their land to produce to its potential to focus his promotion of more <strong>sustainable agricultural practices</strong> to target those areas
          </li>
