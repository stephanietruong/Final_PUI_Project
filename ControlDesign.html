        <p class="item-intro text-muted">Redesign the controls for window blinds</p>
      </div>

      <h5>PROJECT BACKGROUND</h5>
      <p> Controls have been the fundamental building blocks of interaction design to help relay the user's intention or desire for the system to understand and act on the intent. The goal of the project is to to find a real-world control that needs to be improved and then re-imagine the control to redesign it.</p>
      <br>

      <h5> CURRENT STATE</h5>
      <p> First, I went around to brainstorm which control I wanted to redesign and I landed on the window blind control.

      <p>There are so many different window blinds such as the traditional blinds or roller blinds with the fabric shades. I decided to focus on the traditional venetian style blinds that was most commonly found in household.
      </p>
      <img id="blindsImg" src = "img/portfolio/blinds-schuyler-dugle-unsplash.jpg">
      <br><br>
      
      <p>
      Currently, there are two different ways to control the window blinds. 
      <br>1. The tilt wand is used to change the angle of the slats.
      <br>2. The lift cord is used to raise the entire blind up and down.</p>

      <h5>PROBLEM</h5>
      <h6>1. Tilt Wand:</h6>
      <p>
      There is a perpetual affordance that when people comes up to the tilt wand, they will want to turn it since it is a cylinder shape. However, for those who never interact with a blind, they might even pull on it since it is long and thin. There is currently no feedforward at all. Just looking at the tilt wand, one does not know what its function is. There is nothing for us to anticipate the action from having us turn the rod. In addition, it is difficult to know which way to even turn the rod if the user wanted to open the slats at a particular angle. Turning the rod in circle does not show how the angle of the blind will change. </p>
      
      
      <h6>2. Lift Cord </h6>
      <p>There is a perpetual affordance that when a users come by the window blinds and see the cord, they will want to pull it. However, the current problem is that it is hard to pull on the cord to lift the blinds. Sometimes, it requires a lot of force. When pulling up the lift cord, a person will need to tug it at a certain angle for the blind to come all the way down. It is also difficult to stop the blind at a certain level.</p>

      <p>Overall, there are two separate controls for the window blinds. For first time users, it will be confusing to know which parts control what. There is not enough feedforward for the users to know what outcome will happen from looking at these controls.</p>
      <br>

      <h5>COMPETITIVE ANALYSIS</h5>
      
      <H6> 1. Remote Control </H6>
      <p>
      There are blinds that are controlled from a remote. This allows users to control the window without physically interacting with the blinds. Many of these remote controls are for the roller blade with the fabric shade while some also change the tilt. Most of the remote control is two button going up and down.
       
      <h6> 2. Lift & Lock & Tilt</h6>
      <p>There are blinds that do not have the cord or wand. It is controlled by a handle at the bottom of the blind that will allow users to just lift up the bottom rail to raise the shades up or down. There is a Lift & Lock system where the blinds can be raised, lowers, or locked with a push of a button. This solves the issue of change how much the blinds should go up or down. The Lift & Tilt system allows the blind to be lift and lower while also tilting to choose the angle where the slats are in.
      </p>
      <br>

      <h5>FINAL DESIGN</h5>
          <p>
            By redesigning the window blind control, it was easy for people to move up and down and open and close the blinds all in one control. When people are in a rush, they do not need to necessarily use their hands to physically pull down and close the blind. By using any part of the body to push the thumb wheel switch all the way down with enough force, it will also drag the slider down to make it easier to close all your blind at once. As opposed to the remote, people would not have to control the blinds through repetitive motion of continuioiously clicking on a button. This new control makes it easier to adjust the blind without dealing with repetitive motion of a button or the hassle of pulling on a cord or turning a rod. </p>
            
            <p>A. <strong>Percepetual Affordance: </strong>Having the finger impressions on the side, it provides the contact for the users to move it up and down. I think having he slider track, users can see that the slider can move up and down. Having the switch on the thumbwheel, people will want to move it up and down. 
            </p>
            <p>
            B. <strong>Feedforward: </strong>The feedforward of the design is that the users can know at which level the blinds are at from the position it is on. 
            </p>
            <p>
            C. <strong>Feedback: </strong> The feedback of the design is that they should be able to see the blinds move at the same time they move the design.
