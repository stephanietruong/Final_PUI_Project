        <h5>PROJECT BACKGROUND</h5>
        <p> Controls have been the fundamental building blocks of interaction design to help relay the user's intention or desire for the system to understand and act on the user’s intent. The goal of the project was to find a real-world control that could be improved and then re-imagine and re-design the control.</p>

        <p> This project allowed me to go back to the basic and break down the common everyday controls we have around us to understand how they work. Many of the times we will just instinctually know how to operate a control without being taught. This is because a good controls won’t need to come with an instruction manual because all you need is the control itself. You can observe the shape of it (perceptual affordance) to know how to Interact with it such pull, push, or turn it. It was a breathe of fresh air in this digital world where most control might be through a screen. </p>

        <h5> CURRENT STATE</h5>
        <p> For this project, I focused on the traditional venetian style blinds that was most commonly found in household.</p>

        <p> Currently, there are two different ways to control the window blinds. 
        <br>1. The tilt wand is used to change the angle of the slats.
        <br>2. The lift cord is used to raise the entire blind up and down.</p>
        <br>
      </div>
      <!-- END OF EMPATHIZE STAGE-->
      
      <!-- DEFINE STAGE -->
      <div id = "define">

        <div class ="aboutFS" >
          <div class="scroll-animations">
            <div class="animated"> 
              <img src="img/define.png" id="aboutImg">
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>

        <h5>PROBLEM</h5>
        <h6>1. Tilt Wand:</h6>
        <p> By observing the shape of the tilt wand, there are a number of actions we can take. People might want to turn it since it is a cylinder shape. But they might even pull on it since it is long and thin. There is currently no feedforward at all. Just by looking at the tilt wand, one does not know what its function is. There is nothing for us to anticipate the action that comes from us turning the rod. In addition, it is difficult to know which way to turn the rod for the slats to be at a particular angle. Turning the rod in circle does not show how the angle of the blind will change with it. </p>
      
      
        <h6>2. Lift Cord </h6>
        <p>The perpetual affordance of the lift cord is that when a user sees the cord, they will want to pull it. However, the current problem is that it is hard to pull on the cord to lift the blinds. Sometimes, it requires a lot of force. When pulling up the lift cord, a person will need to tug it at a certain angle for the blind to come all the way up and another angle for it to come down. It is also difficult to stop the blind at a certain ideal level.</p>

        <p>Overall, there are two separate controls for the window blinds. For first time users, it will be confusing to know which part controls what. There is not enough feedforward for the users to know what outcome will happen from looking at these controls.</p>
      <br>
<!-- 
      <h5>COMPETITIVE ANALYSIS</h5>
      <H6> 1. Remote Control </H6>
      <p>
      There are blinds that are controlled from a remote. This allows users to control the window without physically interacting with the blinds. Many of these remote controls are for the roller blade with the fabric shade while some also change the tilt. Most of the remote control is two button going up and down.
       
      <h6> 2. Lift & Lock & Tilt</h6>
      <p>There are blinds that do not have the cord or wand. It is controlled by a handle at the bottom of the blind that will allow users to just lift up the bottom rail to raise the shades up or down. There is a Lift & Lock system where the blinds can be raised, lowers, or locked with a push of a button. This solves the issue of change how much the blinds should go up or down. The Lift & Tilt system allows the blind to be lift and lower while also tilting to choose the angle where the slats are in.

      <!-- IDEATE STAGE -->
      <div id = "prototype">
          <div class ="aboutFS" >
            <div class="scroll-animations">
              <div class="animated"> 
                <img src="img/prototype.png" id="aboutImg">
              </div>
            </div>
          </div>

        <h5>FINAL DESIGN</h5>
        <p> By redesigning the window blind control, ii made it easy for people to move up and down and open and close the blinds all in one control. When people are in a rush, they do not need to necessarily use their hands to physically pull down and close the blind. By using any part of the body to push the thumb wheel switch all the way down with enough force, it will also drag the slider down to make it easier to close all your blind at once. As opposed to the remote, people would not have to control the blinds through repetitive motion of continuously clicking on a button. This new control makes it easier to adjust the blind without dealing with repetitive motion of a button or the hassle of pulling on a cord or turning a rod. </p>
          
        <p> A. <strong>Perceptual Affordance: </strong>Having the finger impressions on the side, it provides the contact for the users to move it up and down. I think having he slider track, users can see that the slider can move up and down. Having the switch on the thumbwheel, people will want to move it up and down. </p>

        <p> B. <strong>Feedforward: </strong>The feedforward of the design is that the users can know at which level the blinds are at from the position it is on. </p>

        <p>C. <strong>Feedback: </strong> The feedback of the design is that they should be able to see the blinds move at the same time they move the design.</p>
