        <h5>PROJECT BACKGROUND</h5>
        <p> Controls have been the fundamental building blocks of interaction design to help relay the user's intention or desire for the system to understand and act on the userâ€™s intent. The goal of the project was to find a real-world control that could be improved and then re-imagine and re-design the control.</p>

        <h5> CURRENT STATE</h5>
        <p> For this project, I focused on the traditional venetian style blinds that was most commonly found in household.</p>

        <p> Currently, there are two different ways to control the window blinds. 
        <br>1. The tilt wand is used to change the angle of the slats
        <br>2. The lift cord is used to raise the entire blind up and down</p>
        <br>
      </div>

      <!-- DEFINE STAGE -->
      <div id = "define">

        <div class ="aboutFS" >
          <div class="scroll-animations">
            <div class="animated"> 
              <img src="img/define.png" id="aboutImg">
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>

        <h5>PROBLEM</h5>

        <div id = "rightControls">
          <img src="img/portfolio/control/blindsBreakdown.png" id = "blindsBreakdown">
        </div>

        <div id= "leftControls">
        
        <h6>1. Tilt Wand:</h6>
        <p> By observing the shape of the tilt wand, there are a number of actions we can take. There is currently <strong>no feedforward</strong> at all. Just by looking at the tilt wand, a person does not know what its function is. There is nothing for us to anticipate the action that comes from us turning the rod. In addition, it is difficult to know in which direction and how far we should turn the rod for the slats to be at a specific angle. </p>
      
        <h6>2. Lift Cord </h6>
        <p>The <strong> perpetual affordance </strong> the lift cord gives is that when a user sees the cord, they will want to pull it. However, the current problem is that it is hard to pull on the cord to lift the blinds. Sometimes, it requires a lot of force. When pulling up the lift cord, a person will need to tug it at a certain angle for the blind to come all the way up and another angle for it to come down. It is also difficult to stop the blind at a certain ideal level.</p>
        </div>

        <div class= "clear"></div>
        <p>Overall, there are two separate controls for the window blinds. And for first time users, it will be confusing to know which part controls what. There is not enough feedforward for the users to know what outcome will happen from looking at these controls.</p>

      <!-- IDEATE STAGE -->
      <div id = "prototype">

          <div class ="aboutFS" >
            <div class="scroll-animations">
              <div class="animated"> 
                <img src="img/prototype.png" id="aboutImg">
              </div>
            </div>
          </div>

        <h5>INITIAL PROTOTYPE</h5>
        <p>Initially, I focused on redesigning the tilt wand to make it easier for users to change the angle of the slats. I decided to sketch out some designs to make it a slider. After creating the initial prototype with the slider, it seemed like it would be more intuitive to integrate the tilt wand and lift cord into the same control. I wanted to integrate it like a switch and slider. The sliders should be the main thing that moves the entire blind up and down and the switch can change the angle of the slats.
        </p>
        <img src="img/portfolio/control/prototype3.png" class="projectPic" style="margin-bottom: .5em;">
         
        <img src="img/portfolio/control/prototype.png" class="projectPic">
        <br><br>

        <p>I was thinking of ways to make this control more intuitive to use. I got inspired to make it more like a computer mouse. In the design of a mouse, the users can make two motions simultaneously. Users could use the small wheel to move the page up and the down and also moved the entire mouse at the same time. Therefore, for the final product, I added finger impressions on the side of the slider block to make more it clearer to the user that they can put their hand around the unit to move it. I made the slider bigger to exaggerate that it could move along the slider bar.
        </p>

        <br><br><br>
        <h5>FINAL DESIGN</h5>
        <p> By redesigning the window blind control, I made it easy for people to move up and down and open and close the blinds all in one control. When people are in a rush, they do not need to necessarily use their hands to physically pull down and close the blind. By using any part of the body to push the thumb wheel switch all the way down with enough force, it will also drag the slider down to make it easier to close all your blind at once. As opposed to the remote, people will not have to control the blinds through repetitive motion of continuously clicking on a button. This new control makes it easier to adjust the blind without dealing with repetitive motion of a button or the hassle of pulling on a cord or turning a rod. </p>
