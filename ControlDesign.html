        <h5>PROJECT BACKGROUND</h5>
        <p> Controls have been the fundamental building blocks of interaction design to help relay the user's intention or desire for the system to understand and act on the user’s intent. The goal of the project was to find a real-world control that could be improved and then re-imagine and re-design the control.</p>

        <p> This project allowed me to go back to the basic and break down the common everyday controls we have around us to understand how they work. Many of the times, we will just instinctually know how to operate a control without being taught. This is because a good control won’t need an instruction manual because all you need is the control itself. You can observe the shape of it (perceptual affordance) to know how to interact with it such pull, push, or turn the controls. Therefore, this project was a breath of fresh air in this digital world where most controls are found screen.</p>

        <h5> CURRENT STATE</h5>
        <p> For this project, I focused on the traditional venetian style blinds that was most commonly found in household.</p>

        <p> Currently, there are two different ways to control the window blinds. 
        <br>1. The tilt wand is used to change the angle of the slats.
        <br>2. The lift cord is used to raise the entire blind up and down.</p>

        <h5>PROBLEM</h5>

        <div id = "rightControls">

        <h6>1. Tilt Wand:</h6>
        <p> By observing the shape of the tilt wand, there are a number of actions we can take. People might want to turn it since it is a cylinder shape. But they might even pull on it since it is long and thin. There is currently <strong>no feedforward</strong> at all. Just by looking at the tilt wand, one does not know what its function is. There is nothing for us to anticipate the action that comes from us turning the rod. In addition, it is difficult to know which way to turn the rod for the slats to be at a particular angle. Turning the rod in circle does not show how the angle of the blind will change with it. </p>
      
      
        <h6>2. Lift Cord </h6>
        <p>The perpetual affordance of the lift cord is that when a user sees the cord, they will want to pull it. However, the current problem is that it is hard to pull on the cord to lift the blinds. Sometimes, it requires a lot of force. When pulling up the lift cord, a person will need to tug it at a certain angle for the blind to come all the way up and another angle for it to come down. It is also difficult to stop the blind at a certain ideal level.</p>
        </div>

        <div class= "clear"></div>
        <p>Overall, there are two separate controls for the window blinds. For first time users, it will be confusing to know which part controls what. There is not enough feedforward for the users to know what outcome will happen from looking at these controls.</p>

      <!-- IDEATE STAGE -->
      <div id = "prototype">

          <div class ="aboutFS" >
            <div class="scroll-animations">
              <div class="animated"> 
                <img src="img/prototype.png" id="aboutImg">
              </div>
            </div>
          </div>

        <h5>INITIAL PROTOTYPE</h5>
        <p>Initially, I focused on redesigning the tilt wand to make it easier for users to change the angle of the slats. I decided to sketch out some designs to make it a slider. I noticed that the slats could be pointed upward and downwards so I thought of using a slider to depict this action will be more intuitive.
        <br><br>
        After creating the initial prototype with the slider, it seemed like it would be more intuitive to integrate the tilt wand and lift cord into the same control. I wanted to integrate it like a switch and slider. The sliders should be the main thing that moves the entire blind up and down. I also wanted it to create a switch that could be moved in discrete state. The switch would be the same control as the slider. I created them to move together as one unit.
        </p>

        <br><br>

        <img src="img/portfolio/control/prototype3.png" class="projectPic">
        <br><br>

        <p>I was thinking of ways to make this control more intuitive to use. I wanted to create it so that it was similar to a mouse. In the design of a mouse, there could be two similar motions. Users could move the small wheel and moved the entire mouse at the same time. Therefore, for the final product, I was thinking that I should make finger impressions on the side of the slider block to make more it clearer to the user that they can put their hand around the unit to move it. I made the slider bigger to exaggerate that it could move along the slider bar.
        </p>

        <br><br>
        <h5>FINAL DESIGN</h5>
        <p> By redesigning the window blind control, I made it easy for people to move up and down and open and close the blinds all in one control. When people are in a rush, they do not need to necessarily use their hands to physically pull down and close the blind. By using any part of the body to push the thumb wheel switch all the way down with enough force, it will also drag the slider down to make it easier to close all your blind at once. As opposed to the remote, people would not have to control the blinds through repetitive motion of continuously clicking on a button. This new control makes it easier to adjust the blind without dealing with repetitive motion of a button or the hassle of pulling on a cord or turning a rod. </p>
          
        <p> A. <strong>Perceptual Affordance: </strong>Having the finger impressions on the side, it provides the contact for the users to move it up and down. I think having he slider track, users can see that the slider can move up and down. Having the switch on the thumbwheel, people will want to move it up and down. </p>

        <p> B. <strong>Feedforward: </strong>The feedforward of the design is that the users can know at which level the blinds are at from the position it is on. </p>

        <p>C. <strong>Feedback: </strong> The feedback of the design is that they should be able to see the blinds move at the same time they move the design.</p>
