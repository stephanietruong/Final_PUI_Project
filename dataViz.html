                                We first did a lot of research on the current climate and biodiversity issues for Sub-Saharan Africa. We used all of our findings to scope our focus to prioritize the most critical threats and we narrowed our key indiciators that we will use for our dashboard. 
                                <br><br>
                                Sub-Saharan Africa is a diverse places with a wide range of habitats and ecosystems. However, a number of species’ population was dependent on rainfall, temperature, and degree of topographical and habitat variation.

                                Our Initial Indicators: <br>

                        <p>
                       After going through a couple of iterations, we decided to further narrow down the scope of the dashboard. We wanted to only show the most important part of the dashboard to the users. We made the center of the dashboard revolve around the population of the elephants since elephants were really sensitive to climate change. After researching about Sub-Saharan Africa's economy, we found out that agriculture made up about 42% of the Sub-Saharan Africa’s income. Therefore, the policy makers would want to focus on those areas with high profit yields that would help increase GDP. Secondly, the region’s human inhabitants suffered severely from hunger. As such, better crop production was also crucial because of its potential to help reduce these problematic hunger rates. Although agricultural development iwa widespread in the region, crop production was still not meeting demand. Therefore, these policymakers would mainly be care about the increasing crop production,and ways they could better utilize the current agricultural land.
