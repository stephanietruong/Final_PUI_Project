      <h5>PROJECT SUMMARY</h5>
       <p> 
       After undergoing surgery, patients often have questions and concerns about their post-operative treatments. Therefore, patients require support from clinical staff over the phone or in the clinic to address common concerns. With these overwhelming amount of phone calls, staff members often have to dedicate significant portions of time after hours to answer all these calls.
       <br> <br>

       Our team conducted numerous stages of research, ideation, prototyping, and testing to finally create Hebo, a post-operative care digital assistant that used voice, text, and images to convey care information and instructions to patients.
      <BR><BR>

      For this project, I helped planned out the different design stages as the project manager to ensure we met deadlines. I played a bigger role on the user research and testing phase in which I empathized and interacted directly with hospital staffs and patients.

      <h5 style="margin-top:32px;">RESEARCH APPROACH</h5>
      <p>Our team created a plan to identify our research goals and methods we planned to use to understand the current state and empathize with patients and hospital staffs. We created the following hunt statement to guide our research.</p>

      <blockquote>
        In order to successfully address the post-operative concerns of carcinoma patients, we will work to understand the patient mindset, identify the challenges that patients face, and explore media that are optimal for communicating relevant post-operative solutions.
      </blockquote>

	        <p>We chose research methods that would best convey not only the breakdowns in the care process, but also the mindsets of both patients and nurses.</p>

	        <ul class = "dashed" style="margin-top:0em;">
	          <li style="margin-bottom: .6em;"><strong> <u>Literature review:</u></strong> To understand the current post-operative care process, gain knowledge on pain management, and the relationship elderly people have with current technologies </li>

	          <li style="margin-bottom: .6em;"><strong> <u>Heuristic evaluation of the client's current app:</u></strong> While this app wasn't being used due to the lack of interest and usability from the client’s patients, we performed this evaluation to determine the basic needs of patients, model the thought process of the nurses’ and doctors’ diagnoses, and understand what needs weren’t filled by the existing app.</li>

	          <li style="margin-bottom: .6em;"><strong> <u>Contextual inquiries and interviews with nurses and doctors:</u></strong> To identify current processes and breakdowns by shadowed nurses and doctors </li>

	           <li style="margin-bottom: .6em;"><strong> <u>Contextual inquiries and interviews with patients:</u></strong> To understand the patients’ mindset before and after the surgery, how they felt, and what they do during the post-operative period</li>

	           <li style="margin-bottom: .6em;"><strong> <u>Call logs of questions that patients frequently asked:</u></strong> To identify the type of questions patients asked hospital staffs during their post-operative process</li>

	           <li style="margin-bottom: .6em;"><strong> <u>Diary studies: </u></strong> To discover what problems patients commonly face after surgery and what actions they take to address concerns they have</li>
	        </ul>

        <h5>SYNTHESIZING THE DATA</h5>
        	<p>After we gathered all information from our research, we synthesized our findings by clustering our insights, created different personas, models, and journey maps.</p> 
          
          <p><strong>Key Insights</strong><br>
            <ol>
                <li style="margin-bottom: .6em;"> Patients look for <strong><em>greater reassurance</em></strong> and <strong><em>personalized care</em></strong> from the post-operative process</li>
                <li style="margin-bottom: .8em;"> Patients can become <strong><em>self-conscious</em></strong> and concerned about their appearance after undergoing procedures</li>
                <li style="margin-bottom: .6em;"> Doctors <strong><em>think</em></strong> that they are providing patients with all of the information they need, but this is not always the case</li>
                <li style="margin-bottom: .6em;"> Nurses feel that some post-operative calls are <strong><em>redundant</em></strong> as questions that patients were asking had already been answered in the post-operative care instruction packet or previous calls</li>
                <li style="margin-bottom: .6em;"> Most nurses will <strong><em>postpone </em></strong> a patient’s post-operative call in order to be able to make a more <strong><em>personalized and accurate recommendation</em></strong> for the patient</li>
                <li style="margin-bottom: .6em;"> The predominant demographic of skin cancer patients, the elderly population, calls for an emphasis on <strong><em>accessibility</em></strong> and <strong><em>simplicity</em></strong></li>
            </ol>
            <br>

          <p><strong>Personas</strong><br>
            <p>From all our research, we created detailed personas to build empathy with our target users.</p>

            <ul class = "dashed">
                <li style="margin-bottom: .5em;"> An elderly couple, where one spouse is undergoing surgery and the other is a caregiver </li>
                <li style ="margin-bottom: .5em;"> An elderly patient, who will be taking care of herself</li>
                <li style ="margin-bottom: 0.5em;"> A nurse, who works in a dermatologic surgery clinic</li>
            </ul>
          <p>Here is an example of one of our personas:</p>
          <img src="img/portfolio/hebo/persona.png" style="width:100%;">

          <br><br>
        	<p><strong>Cultural Model</strong></p>
          <p>A cultural model attempts to capture the relationships between stakeholders of a given system and the central motivations that drive their actions. Mapping out the relationships between and motivations of each of the players helped us get a better sense of how the system functions as a whole.</p>
        	<img src="img/portfolio/hebo/heboModels.png" class="projectPic">
          
          <br><br>
         	<p><strong>Sequence Flow Model</strong></p>
          <p>Sequence flow models are used to analyze the steps a stakeholder takes in a given procedure, including identifying touch points and breakdowns. Our model describes the average process a patient experience from scheduling their surgery to their final follow-up. 
          <br><br>
          We were able to pinpoint three major breakdowns of inefficiency in the patient’s current surgery timeline: </p>

          <ol>
                <li style="margin-bottom: .5em;"> During the initial scheduling call </li>
                <li style ="margin-bottom: .5em;"> At wound closure when care instructions are introduced</li>
                <li style ="margin-bottom: 0.5em;"> At home during recovery </li>
            </ol>
            <p>These points could be potential opportunities for our intervention and were the springboards for many of our solutions.</p>

        <h5> IDEATION PROCESS</h5>
        
        		<p>To proceed with our ideation process, we began a visioning session to brainstorm possible solutions. Afterwards, we placed all the ideas onto a matrix that measure the user’s value against the feasibility of the idea. </p>

        		<img src="img/portfolio/hebo/ideas.png" style="display: block;margin: 0 auto; width:60%;"><br>
       

        <p><strong>Storyboards </strong> </p>

        	<p>From there, our team narrowed down the top ideas and identified three solutions to further develop and explore: a wound care simulation tutorial, a personalized patient pamphlet, and a machine learning-driven wound checker application. We further developed what the experience of the three solutions would be by developing a script and visuals for storyboards. <!-- These storyboards helped us envision how a particular solution might fit into a patient’s post-operative care process and ease certain breakdowns from our sequence model flow. --></p>

        <h5>PROTOTYPE AND USER TESTING </h5>
	        <p>Our team decided to <strong> parallel prototype </strong> 2 possible solutions to which was the chatbot and the interactive tutorial on post-operative care. 
          <br><br>

          The chatbot was supposed to be an intelligent FAQ. To test the chatbot, we used the <strong>Wizard-of-Oz technique</strong>, where we pretended to be the chatbot and asked participants to interact with ‘us’.

          <br><br>
          For the interactive tutorial, we created a storyline that incorporates instructions taken from the original care sheet in order to teach patients how to care for themselves and prompt any questions that may arise once they get home. 
          </p>

          <br><br>

          <p><strong>Insights from testing</strong></p>
          <ul class = "dashed" style="margin-top:0em;">
            <li style="margin-bottom: .6em;"> Voice is good, but we can’t have just voice.</li>

            <li style="margin-bottom: .6em;"> Our solution needs to work both at the doctor’s office and at home.</li>

            <li style="margin-bottom: .6em;"> Patients only want answers when they are relevant.</li>

             <li style="margin-bottom: .6em;"> Visual elements aid patient understanding.</li>

             <li style="margin-bottom: .6em;"> Patients trust tools that are more immediately derived from the doctor’s office.</li>

             <li style="margin-bottom: .6em;"> Patients want a way to reference what they’ve learned.</li>
             <li style="margin-bottom: .6em;"> Patients want to express their thoughts... Doctors want to know what patients are thinking.</li>
             <li style="margin-bottom: .6em;"> Patients find it useful to write down questions that they want to ask later.</li>
          </ul>
          <br>


        <h6> Next iteration </h6>
	        <p> For this new iteration of our solution, we wanted our product to be a chatbot with limited conversation topics designed to answer questions specific to the patient’s surgery experience using voice and visuals.</p>
   
	        <p>We performed multiple users testing session with different stages of our prototype. <!-- Our target audience included patients from the clinic, in addition to the nurses and other potential users who were above the age of 60.  -->Participants were invited to spend some time interacting with Hebo while performing a <strong> think-aloud </strong> and then follow-up in a brief interview. <!-- Our user testing sessions produced a significant amount of valuable feedback and insights that we use to modify and iterate on the design of Hebo.  -->

        <h5> CONCLUSION </h5>
        <p> Due to the short timeline, our team worked to create a proof of concept that provides evidence that the personal assistant, Hebo, would help decrease the amount of patient calls. 
        <br><br>
        Our diary study was a major way that we collected patient concerns and questions that our client previously was not aware that patients had. This research method surprisingly reduced the number of phone calls as patients were jotting down non-urgent questions in their diary to ask during the next follow-up appointments instead of calling in. Therefore, this can be a new feature we can add to Hebo. 

        <br><br>
        In order to build out a successful and comprehensive chatbot interface for patients, Hebo’s scope must be expanded to all aspects of patient care. Our team created a detailed transition and feasible scalability plan that allow the introduction of Hebo to multiple different clinicians serving Mohs surgery patients.
