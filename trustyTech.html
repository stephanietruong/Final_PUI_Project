        <p> 
          Businesses that provide home services such as cable, plumbing, electrical and heating are adapting to the changing expectations of customers who are dissatisfied with the service scheduling and delivery experience. Historically, scheduling a service visit to a home is done several days in advance. Customers are required to identify a day and a 4-hour “arrival window” for the service provider to visit the home and be at the home to explain the problem in greater detail and authorize repairs. Service provider require customers wait in the home for the service provider to call them with the exact time they will be in the home.
          <br><br>
          This approach often has negative outcomes for both customers and home service providers. For example, customers often wait for hours only to be told by the service provider that they will not be visiting their home today. On the other hand, customers who did not want to wait in the home increasingly gave service providers a mobile phone number so that they could leave the home to go to work or run errands. The challenge is to optimize the scheduling, rescheduling, joint decision making and service delivery to produce better outcomes for both home owners and service providers.

        <h5>PERSONAS</h5>
        <img src="img/portfolio/trustyTech/trustytechPersona.png" class = "projectPic">

        <h5>ECOSYSTEM COLLECTION</h5>
        <p> First, we have to figure out who is the key <strong>ACTORS</strong> for this problem. There are two main parties: the customer (tenants/homeowners) and the multiple home service providers (technicans). The influencers in decision for the customer can include the family and friends of the customers and other people living in the same home. Customer must do a series of tasks to figure out what needs to be fixed, their preferred provider, their avaliablity and scheduling an appoinemnt, and actually being there when the technicans arrives

         Meanwhile, for the technicans, they are influenced by the scheduling managers and the technican's boss. They have multiple request per days and they follow a tight schedule given by the schedulign manager. They will need to do their best to solve a customer's issue no matter how long it takes so it is hard for them to manage their time. They will just let the operator know when they finished a job and then they move on to the other customer. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <h5>GUERILLA RESEARCH</h5>
        <p>
          We identified the following gaps in our knowledge:</p>
          <ul class="dashed">
            <li style="margin-bottom: .5em;"> Logistics of how the technician schedules his visits </li>
            <li style="margin-bottom: .5em;"> Step by step process of how a home service request is scheduled by the customer</li>
            <li style="margin-bottom: .5em;">Why customers are not staying at home to wait for their technican? </li>
            <li style="margin-bottom: .5em;">Competitive analysis of existing applications in this area</li>
          </ul>
        <p>To fill these gaps in our knowledge of this topic, we conducted multiple interviews and additionally researched existing services online. To learn more about how home service providers handle/schedule their requests, we interviewed a local technician. Additionally, we interviewed a student who had recently hired a home service provider to gain insights as to their experience.</p>

          <div class="scroll-animations">

          </div>
        </div>


        <h5>KEY INSIGHTS</h5>
        <p> After we completed and analyzed our Guerilla Research, we discovered some main findings that we used to motivate our exploratory scenarios:</p>
        <ul class="dashed">
          <li style="margin-bottom: .5em;"> Customers are not comfortable letting in technicians into their empty homes, unless they are familiar with the technician.</li>
          <li style="margin-bottom: .5em;"> Customers have difficulty in distinguishing among contractors on the basis of quality</li>
          <li style="margin-bottom: .5em;"> There are already many existing applications that aim to optimize the scheduling process, but customers are still constrained by having to wait at home for the technician during a large time window.</li>
          <li style="margin-bottom: .5em;"> Most of the communication to customer is through the dispatcher and they need to get update from the technican. If the technicians need to stay a couple of more hours to do additional work, they can and must let the dispatcher know. They will call if when the technician is running late or when he/she is on the way</li>
        </ul>
        <br>

        <h5> EXPLORATORY SCENARIOS</h5>
        <p> We created 20 explanatory scenarios to understand which aspect of the problem to focus on. Here are an examples of 3 below:</p> 

        <p>
        <strong>Problem/Context:</strong> Scott wants to get some last-minute holiday shopping done during his scheduled appointment window and doesn’t want to stay at home for his home-service appointment.
        <br>
        <strong>Solution:</strong> Scott uses an app that lets him fill out a pre-appointment information sheet specific to the work being done in his house (where his circuit box is, where his router is, etc) that the Alyssa, the technician, can use to facilitate her work.
        <br>
        <strong>Resolution:</strong> Alyssa doesn’t require any more information from Scott so he is able to go to the mall to get the very last Tickle-Me-Elmo for his daughter.
        </p>

        <p>
        <strong>Problem/Context:</strong> Scott’s schedule is constantly changing and he doesn’t know if he’ll be able to stay home for an appointment until the morning of.
        <br>
        <strong>Solution:</strong> Alyssa’s company allows him to set-up multiple appointment times as backups for a quick, flexible change.
        <br>
        <strong>Resolution:</strong> Scott feels as though someone else if being as flexible as he is during this process and is able to not miss any important meetings due to his altering schedule.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Problem/Context:</strong> Scott schedules an appointment with the home service provider to fix a pipe. He does not stay at home but instead, he goes to work which is 10 minutes from his house. He waits for the technicians to let him know he is on his way so he can rush home but he isn’t able to make it back in time when the technician arrived.
          <br>
          <strong>Solution:</strong> Scott has an app to track how far away the technician is and how long it will take Scott to get back home.
          <br>
          <strong>Resolution:</strong> Scott was able to get back home on time before the technician arrived.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Problem/Context:</strong> Scott has an home-service appointment scheduled for the afternoon but just got a big project dumped on him at work.
          <br>
          <strong>Solution:</strong> Scott uses an app that lets him video chat with his technician to view what work is being done as well as to assist which areas need work to be done. 
          <br>
          <strong>Resolution:</strong> Scott is able to finish his big project without leaving to go home to help the
          technician.
        </p>

          </div>
        </div>


        <h5> STORYBOARDS </h5>
        <p> We narrowed down the scenarios and further developed what the experience of the three solutions would be by developing a script and visuals for storyboards.  </p>

        <p><strong>Value for Scott, the customer</strong>
        <br>Scott is able to take on an extra substitute job despite the unexpected heater issue. Our application frees him from the burden of having to wait around at home for a technician, which allows him to keep his schedule open and do the things that he actually wants.</p>
        <img src="img/portfolio/trustyTech/storyboard1.png" class = "projectPic"><br><br>

        <p> <strong>Value for Alyssa, the home service provider/technician</strong>
        <br>Our application makes the employees’ jobs a lot more efficient because they no longer need to deal with customers rescheduling or cancelling appointments, or not being home at the scheduled time. They also no longer have to worry about running late to appointments.</p>
        <img src="img/portfolio/trustyTech/storyboard2.png" class = "projectPic"><br><br>

        <p><strong>Added value for Alyssa, the home service provider</strong>
        <br>The recorded videos may be used to train multiple new employees at once instead of having ridealongs which costs more time and money.</p>
        <img src="img/portfolio/trustyTech/storyboard3.png" class = "projectPic"><br><br>

      <!-- END OF IDEATE STAGE -->

      <!-- PROTOTYPING STAGE -->
      <div id = "prototype">

        <div class ="aboutFS" >
          <div class="scroll-animations">
            <div class="animated"> 
              <img src="img/prototype.png" id="aboutImg">
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>

        <h5>SOLUTION</h5>
        <p>We decided to approach the problem from a different angle, focusing on building trust between customers and home service providers so that we can eliminate scheduling and rescheduling problems altogether.
        <br><br>
        After receiving feedback on our storyboard presentation, we designed TrustyTech; a mobile application that aims to build trust between home service providers and their customers, in order to increase the comfort of unsupervised appointments. Through enabling home service appointments without the need of customer presence, customers no longer have to worry about being at home during long appointment windows, and technicians are able to efficiently add more jobs throughout the day. This allows both parties to be more in control of their schedules.
        <br><br>
        Not only does TrustyTech resolve the issues of scheduling, it also provides an additional value to the home service provider since the recorded livestream videos could be used for training purposes. Thus, both the high costs of rescheduling and training costs could be reduced by the use of TrustyTech.
        </p> <br>

        <h5>INITIAL FEATURES</h5>
        <ul>
          <li style="margin-bottom: .5em;">1. <strong>Live Stream:</strong> Allow customers to view what the technician is doing</li>
          <li style="margin-bottom: .5em;" >2. <strong>Messaging / Chat:</strong> Technician can ask customers questions and allow customers to authorize certain repairs</li>
          <li style="margin-bottom: .5em;">3. <strong>Technician Profile:</strong> Customers can be more comfortable with the technician if they learn more about them
          beforehand</li>
          <li style="margin-bottom: .5em;">4. <strong>Progress Bar:</strong> Customers can track the different stages of the repair</li>
        </ul>
