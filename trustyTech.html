        <h5 id = "aboutProject">PROJECT BACKGROUND</h5>
        <p> 
          Businesses that provide home services such as cable, plumbing, electrical and heating are adapting to the changing expectations of customers who are dissatisfied with the service scheduling and delivery experience. Historically, scheduling a service visit to a home is done several days in advance. Customers are required to identify a day and a 4-hour “arrival window” for the service provider to visit the home and be at the home to explain the problem in greater detail and authorize repairs. Service provider require customers wait in the home for the service provider to call them with the exact time they will be in the home.
          <br><br>
          This approach often has negative outcomes for both customers and home service providers. For example, customers often wait for hours only to be told by the service provider that they will not be visiting their home today. On the other hand, customers who did not want to wait in the home increasingly gave service providers a mobile phone number so that they could leave the home to go to work or run errands. The challenge is to optimize the scheduling, rescheduling, joint decision making and service delivery to produce better outcomes for both home owners and service providers.

        <br>

        <h5>RESEARCH APPROACH</h5>
        <p>There were a lot of these gaps in our knowledge on this topic, we conducted multiple interviews and additionally researched existing services online. To learn more about how home service providers, handle/schedule their requests, we interviewed a local technician. Additionally, we interviewed a student who had recently hired a home service provider to gain insights as to their experience.</p>

      <!-- DEFINE STAGE -->
      <div id = "define">

        <div class ="aboutFS" >
          <div class="scroll-animations">
            <div class="animated">

            </div>
          </div>
        </div>


        <h5>KEY INSIGHTS</h5>
        <p> After we completed and analyzed our research, we discovered some main findings that we used to motivate our exploratory scenarios:</p>
        <ul class="dashed">
          <li style="margin-bottom: .5em;"> Customers have <strong> difficulty in distinguishing</strong> among contractors on the basis of quality.</li>
          <li style="margin-bottom: .5em;"> There are already many existing applications that aim to optimize the scheduling process, but customers are still <strong> constrained by having to wait at home</strong> for the technician during a large time window.</li>
          <li style="margin-bottom: .5em;"> Most of the <strong>communication to customer is through the dispatcher</strong> and they need to get update from the technician. Dispatcher need to understand where technician are on the existing call to manage the expectation of the new calls.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>

        <h5> EXPLORATORY SCENARIOS</h5>
        <p> We created 20 explanatory scenarios for our brainstorming sessions. These sceanarios we created helps us explore how an app might deliver value to the two personas. Here are an examples of one:</p> 
        <p style="margin-left: 40px;">
          <strong>A) Problem/Context:</strong> Scott has a home-service appointment scheduled for the afternoon but just got a big project dumped on him at work.
          <br>
          <strong>B) Solution:</strong> Scott uses an app that lets him video chat with his technician to view what work is being done as well as to assist which areas need work to be done. 
          <br>
          <strong>C) Resolution:</strong> Scott is able to finish his big project without leaving to go home to help the
          technician.
        </p>

      <!-- IDEATE STAGE -->
      <div id = "ideate">

        <div class ="aboutFS" >
          <div class="scroll-animations">
            <div class="animated"> 
              <img src="img/ideate.png" id="aboutImg">
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>


        <h5> STORYBOARDS </h5>
        <p> We narrowed down the scenarios and further developed what the experience of the three solutions we chose would be by developing a script and visuals for storyboards. </p>

        <p><strong>Value for Scott, the customer</strong>
        <br>Scott is able to take on an extra substitute job despite the unexpected heater issue. Our application frees him from the burden of having to wait around at home for a technician, which allows him to keep his schedule open and do the things that he actually wants.</p>
        <img src="img/portfolio/trustyTech/storyboard1.png" class = "projectPic"><br><br>

        <p> <strong>Value for Alyssa, the home service provider/technician</strong>
        <br>Our application makes the employees’ jobs a lot more efficient because they no longer need to deal with customers rescheduling or cancelling appointments, or not being home at the scheduled time. They also no longer have to worry about running late to appointments.</p>
        <img src="img/portfolio/trustyTech/storyboard2.png" class = "projectPic"><br><br>

        <p><strong>Added value for Alyssa, the home service provider</strong>
        <br>The recorded videos may be used to train multiple new employees at once instead of having ridealongs which costs more time and money.</p>

      <!-- END OF IDEATE STAGE -->

      <!-- PROTOTYPING STAGE -->
      <div id = "prototype">

        <div class ="aboutFS" >
          <div class="scroll-animations">
            <div class="animated"> 
              <img src="img/prototype.png" id="aboutImg">
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>

        <h5>SOLUTION</h5>
        <p>We decided to approach the problem from a different angle and focus on building trust between customers and home service providers so that we can eliminate scheduling and rescheduling problems altogether.
        <br><br>
        Our team created TrustyTech; a mobile application that aims to build trust between home service providers and their customers, in order to increase the comfort of unsupervised appointments. Through enabling home service appointments without the need of customer presence, customers no longer have to worry about being at home during long appointment windows, and technicians are able to efficiently add more jobs throughout the day. This allows both parties to be more in control of their schedules.
        <br><br>
        Not only does TrustyTech resolve the issues of scheduling, it also provides an additional value to the home service provider since the recorded livestream videos could be used for training purposes. Thus, both the high costs of rescheduling and training costs could be reduced by the use of TrustyTech.
        </p>

        <h5>INITIAL FEATURES</h5>
        <ul>
          <li style="margin-bottom: .5em;">1. <strong>Live Stream:</strong> Allow customers to view what the technician is doing</li>
          <li style="margin-bottom: .5em;" >2. <strong>Messaging / Chat:</strong> Technician can ask customers questions and allow customers to authorize certain repairs</li>
          <li style="margin-bottom: .5em;">3. <strong>Technician Profile:</strong> Customers can be more comfortable with the technician if they learn more about them
          beforehand</li>
          <li style="margin-bottom: .5em;">4. <strong>Progress Bar:</strong> Customers can track the different stages of the repair</li>
        </ul>

        <br><br>
        <br>
        <h5>REFINING THE PROTOTYPE</h5>
        <p>We received feedback from our first wireframe iteration regarding the feasibility of the progress bar. We determined that this feature was not aligned with our goal of facilitating trust between home service providers and their customers, so we decided to remove it from the second iteration. We did a couple of iteration from the design and here are some of our screens:</p>
