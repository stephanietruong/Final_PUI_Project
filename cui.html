        <h5>PROJECT BACKGROUND</h5>
        <!-- <p> Conversational user interfaces (CUIs) are becoming more and more popular in the common world. These kind of conversational interaction can help benefit users in situations where their hands and or their visual attention are not avaliable. They can also help in situations where the user's needs do not map well to the hierarchical infromation structure of many online system.  For example, it can be easier to say, “I want two orders of Nachos” rather than navigating a restaurant site and selecting online orders, appetizers, nachos, and indicating quantity of two. </p> -->
        <p> For the project, our team designed a novel conversational user interface (CUI) to improve the retail store fitting room experience. A conversation user interface is a platform that mimic a conversation with a real human. Some examples can include chatbots or voice assistants such as Amazon Echo. </p>

        </div>

        <h5>RESEARCH APPROACH</h5>
        <p>
          Right before we started our design, we gathered more information about the current fitting room experience. We started out by going to a couple of retail stores. We conducted some observations on the customer's interaction with trying on clothes and the service they receive from the employees. In addition, we took on the role of a potential customer by going into the fitting room to try on clothes and documented our experiences.
          <br><br>
          Our experiences in all the stores were slightly different. In one of the store, there were no employees on our floor. A couple of people were hesitant when walking to the fitting room since they were not sure if they should go in or out. Most of the customers did not spend much time in the fitting room and none of the ones we observed end up buying clothes.
          <br><br>
          On the other hand, when we went into another store, we had a very personalized experience where we exchanged names and had a conversation with one of the employee. When we asked for more sizes, the employee had a hand-held scanner to quickly check the inventory. Even though the clothes might be more expensive in this store, the care from the associate made us more inclined to make a purchase.

        <h5>KEY INSIGHTS</h5>
        <ul>
          <li style="font-weight:bold">- Fitting rooms are important</li>
            <li style="margin-left:2em; list-style-type: circle; margin-bottom: .5em">They are the key step in converting causal shoppers into buyers and it can also help reduce return rates.</li> 
          <li style="font-weight:bold">- Shoppers need advice when picking on clothes</li>
            <li style="margin-left:2em; list-style-type: circle; margin-bottom: .5em">Typical shopper will ask for advice from friends who accompany them or from other acquaintances through online interactions.</li>

          <li style="font-weight:bold">- Fitting rooms are stressful</li>
            <li style="margin-left:2em; list-style-type: circle; margin-bottom: .5em">69% of women between 25-40 said changing rooms are stressful.</li>

          <li style="font-weight:bold">- The design and the space of fitting rooms are not appealing</li>
            <li style="margin-left:2em; list-style-type: circle; margin-bottom: .5em">Fitting rooms are cramped and there is inadequate lighting. </li>

          <li style="font-weight:bold">Shoppers want self-help</li> 
            <li style="margin-left:2em; list-style-type: circle; margin-bottom: .5em"> Majority of shoppers agree that having self-help technologies improves their shopping experience.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        

        <h5>PROJECT CHALLENGE</h5>
        <p> When designing a CUI, we need to find the harmony between the interactive and functional form. The interactive form corresponds with the type of user input and system feedback. Meanwhile, the functional form corresponds to a computational abstraction that defines the underlying interaction of the CUI. In general, designers struggle to find a harmony between allowing users freedom to act and constraining user expressivity in order to increase the systems understanding and ability to provide what users want.
        <br><br>
        Having a CUI for the fitting room was tricky because most people view that as their alone time. They wouldn’t want to interact with another person in the fitting room unless they know them and heating another voice such as our CUI can freak them out. When people change, it is a sensitive time since they can be naked at time. So the only way we can interact with them is through voice and we can have any intrusive technology such as cameras in the fitting room, which normally will aid the CUI.

        <h5>COMPETITIVE ANALYSIS</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>1. Call Buttons: Alert sales associates when a customer needs assistance . </li>
            <li>2. Whoosh Fitting Room: Allow customers to be browse on their phone and tablet to try on items without leave changing rooms. The item is delivered and discarded through a chute and there is a limited human interaction</li>
            <li>3. Smart Mirror: Allow the customers to interact with the mirror to display more information about products and allow browse to get different colors or size. </li>
            <li>4. Virtual Fitting Rooms: Allow users to try on clothes without undressing. It uses AR to superimpose the clothes on customers.</li>

      <!-- IDEATE STAGE -->
      <div id = "ideate">

        <div class ="aboutFS" >
          <div class="scroll-animations">
            <div class="animated"> 
              <img src="img/ideate.png" id="aboutImg">
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>

        <h5> DESIGN OPPORTUNITIES</h5>
        <p>Not much of the fitting room experience has changed over the years. Most of the time, you will be lead into a small space to try on clothes. You look at yourself in the mirror to see if it is a good fit or sometimes take pictures of yourself and send it to your friends to get their opinion. Most of the time, you might not know if it fits well and you're debating whether or not you want to try a different size. You peek out of your fitting room to see if there is an associate around but there is none around. You decide it was not worth it and just leave the store without buying anything.</p>
        <p> CUI can help provide faster service; a better and more personalized shopping experience to the customer. Customers can quickly access information on store inventory and they can freely ask questions to the CUI instead of waiting for an associate to help. In addition, it can improve the fitting room experience to make it less stressful and more personalized to increase customer satisfactions and encourage them to finish of their journey with a purchase. With the CUI, we can help customize the dressing room atmosphere such as lighting and noise to make it a more comfortable experience. </p>
        <br>

        <h5> INITIAL SCENARIOS</h5>
        <p> Our initial idea was around changing the environment of the fitting room to make the customer feel more comfortable and showing them contexts in which their clothes could be worn. After some feedback, we realized that this was way too broad and also doesn’t particularly take advantage of the unique advantages that having a CUI would give the customer, so we went back and mapped the customer’s service journey through the lows and highs. We carryout several experience prototyping sessions to run through the scenarios in which potential users can interact with the CUI. 
        <br><br>
        We decided to narrow our scope more from our feedback. We realized it would be difficult for the CUI to recommend outfits based on people’s different style choices, and we focused on jean fitting, as there is a lot to explore in the seemingly simple task of finding the right jeans including size and style. 
        </p>
        <br>

        <h5> CHANGE SCOPE TO JEAN FITTING </h5>
        <p> We noticed that trying on jeans can be a stressful experience.
          <ul>
            <li>- Experience of finding the right fit and type of jeans is traumatic for 43% of 1000 women surveyed. </li>
            <li>- Customer is unsure whether a pair of jeans fits them well.</li>
            <li>- Overwhelming amount of options in terms of size and style. </li>
            <li>- Everyone’s body shape is UNIQUE</li>
          </ul>
        </p>

      <div id = "prototype">

          </div>
        </div>
        <h5> FINAL DESIGN </h5>
        <p>We created the Fashion Guru that serves as a personal dressing room assistant. It allows customers to ask questions and get advice when it comes to jean fitting. We incorporated movements into a test to help the user effectively check the fit of their jeans. With these movements, there is opportunity to use conversation to interact with the system rather than a GUI. We also gave customers the option of asking a sales associate to bring them new sizes or styles, thus keeping them in the fitting room, increasing convenience for them, and boosting sales.</p>
