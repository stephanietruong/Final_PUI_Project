        <h5>PROJECT BACKGROUND</h5>
        <p> For the project, our team designed a novel conversational user interface (CUI) to improve the retail store fitting room experience. A conversation user interface is a platform that mimics a conversation with a real human. Some examples can include chatbots or voice assistants such as Amazon Echo. </p>

        </div>

        <h5>RESEARCH APPROACH</h5>
        <p>
          Right before we started our design, we gathered more information about the current customer experience with the fitting room. We started out by going to a couple of retail stores to get first-hand experience. We conducted some observations on the customers' interactions with trying on clothes and the service they receive from the employees. In addition, we took on the role of a potential customer by going into the fitting rooms to try on clothes and documented our experiences. Our experiences in all the stores were slightly different and we mapped out different customer journey maps. We also did online research and competitive analysis to understand more about the retail space and the emerging technologies in this industry.

        <h5> DESIGN OPPORTUNITIES</h5>
        <p>Not much of the fitting room experience has changed over the years. Most of the time, you will be lead into a small space to try on clothes. After trying it on, you'll look at yourself in the mirror to see if you like it or not. And you end up taking pictures of yourself and send it to your friends to get their opinions. You're now debating on whether or not you want to try a different size. You peek out of your fitting room to see if there is an associate available but there is no one around. You decide it is not worth it and just leave the store without buying anything.</p>

        <p> However, with a CUI, it can help provide faster service, a better and more personalized shopping experience to the customer. Customers can quickly access information on store inventory and they can freely ask questions to the CUI instead of waiting for an associate to help. In addition, it can improve the fitting room experience to make it less stressful and more personalized to increase customer satisfaction and encourage them to finish of their journey with a purchase. </p>
        <br>

        <h5> INITIAL SCENARIOS</h5>
        <p> Our initial idea was focused on changing the environment of the fitting room to make the customer feel more comfortable and showing them contexts in which their clothes could be worn. After some feedback, we realized that this was way too broad. It also didn't utilize the unique advantages that the CUI could bring to the customer. Therefore, we went back and mapped the customer’s service journey through the lows and highs. We carryout several experience prototyping sessions to run through the scenarios in which potential users could interact with the CUI. 
        <br><br>
        We decided to narrow our scope more from our feedback. We realized it would be difficult for the CUI to recommend outfits based on people’s different style choices, and we focused on jean fitting, as there is a lot to explore in the seemingly simple task of finding the right jeans including size and style. 
        </p>
        <br>

        <h5> CHANGE SCOPE TO JEAN FITTING </h5>
        <p> We noticed that trying on jeans can be a stressful experience.
          <ul class = "dashed">
            <li> Experience of finding the right fit and type of jeans is traumatic for 43% of 1000 women surveyed. </li>
            <li> Customer is unsure whether a pair of jeans fits them well.</li>
            <li> Overwhelming amount of options in terms of size and style. </li>
            <li> Everyone’s body shape is UNIQUE</li>
          </ul>
        </p>

      <!-- PROTOTYPING STAGE -->
      <div id = "prototype">

        <div class ="aboutFS" >
          <div class="scroll-animations">
            <div class="animated">

            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
        <h5> FINAL DESIGN </h5>
        <p>We created the Fashion Guru that serves as a personal dressing room assistant. It allows customers to ask questions and get advice when it comes to jean fitting. We incorporate movements into a test to help the user effectively check the fit of their jeans and figure out which part doesn't fit them well. With these movements, there is opportunity to use conversation to interact with the system rather than a GUI. We also give customers the option of asking a sales associate to bring them new sizes or styles, thus keeping them in the fitting room, increasing convenience for them, and boosting sales.</p>
