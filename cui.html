        <p class="item-intro text-muted">Building a conversational user interface (CUIs) to enhance the retail experience</p>
         <img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="img/portfolio/CUI/shopping.jpg"alt="">

        <h5>PROJECT BACKGROUND</h5>
          <p>In recent years, conversational user interfaces (CUIs) had become more popular with the most advanced offering something approaching a fluent, spoken conversation between humans and machines. The goal of the project was to create a novel conversational user interface (CUI) to improve the retail store dressing room experiences.</p>

        <br>
  
        <h5>RESEARCH APPROACH</h5>
          <p>Right before we started our design, we gathered more information about the current customer experience with the fitting room. We started out by going to a couple of retail stores to get first-hand experience. We conducted some observations on the customers' interactions with trying on clothes and the service they receive from the employees. In addition, we took on the role of a potential customer by going into the fitting rooms to try on clothes and documented our experiences. Our experiences in all the stores were slightly different and we mapped out different customer journey maps. We also did online research and competitive analysis to understand more about the retail space and the emerging technologies in this industry.</p>

        <h5>KEY INSIGHTS</h5>
          <ul class = "dashed1">
            <li class = "dash"> Fitting rooms are important to converting causal shoppers into buyers and it also helps reduce return rates</li> 
            <li class = "dash"> Shoppers need advice when picking on clothes</li>
           

            <li class = "dash"> Fitting rooms are stressful. 69% of women between age 25-40 said changing rooms are stressful for them</li>

            <li class = "dash"> The design and the space of fitting rooms are not appealing. Fitting rooms are cramped and there is inadequate lighting</li>

            <li class = "dash"> Majority of shoppers agree that having self-help technologies will improve their shopping experience</li>
          </ul>

        <br>

        <h5> DESIGN OPPORTUNITIES</h5>
          <p> 
            Not much of the fitting room experience has changed over the years. With a CUI, we can enhance and personalize the shopping experience for customers. Our initial idea was focused on changing the environment of the fitting room to make the customer feel more comfortable and show them the different contexts in which their clothes could be worn. 

            <br><br>
            <strong>Experience prototypes</strong><br>
            We conducted several experience prototyping sessions to run through the scenarios in which potential users could interact with the CUI. After some feedback, we realized that this was way too broad. It also didn't utilize the unique advantages that the CUI could bring to the customer.

            <br><br>
            <strong>Change scope to jean fitting</strong><br>
            We decided to narrow our scope to focus on jean fitting. There was a lot to explore in the seemingly simple task of finding the right jeans including size and style. We noticed that trying on jeans could be a stressful experience.

            <ul class = "dashed">
              <li> Experience of finding the right fit and type of jeans is <strong> traumatic </strong> for 43% of 1000 women surveyed. </li>
              <li> Customer is unsure whether a pair of jeans fits them well.</li>
              <li> There're an overwhelming amount of options in terms of size and style. </li>
              <li> Everyone’s body shape is <strong>UNIQUE</strong></li>
            </ul>
          
            <strong>Inconsistent standard for jeans size</strong><br>
            Below is a chart that shows that each retailer has a different measurements for their "standard" jeans. This makes it almost impossible to go off the same jean sizes across these retailers.
          </p>

        <h5> FINAL DESIGN </h5>
        <p>We created the <strong>Fashion Guru</strong> that served as a personal dressing room assistant. It allowed customers to ask questions and get advice on how they could check if the jeans fitted correctly. We incorporated movements into a test to help the user effectively check the fit of their jeans and figure out which part didn't fit them well. With these movements, there was opportunity to use conversation to interact with the system rather than a GUI. We also gave customers the option of asking a sales associate to bring them new sizes or styles, thus keeping them in the fitting room, increasing convenience for them, and boosting sales.</p>

        <p> Here is an example of a conversation with the Fashion Guru. Please contact me if you want to see a video of how the Fashion Guru works</p>
