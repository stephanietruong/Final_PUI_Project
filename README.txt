There is 4 pages on my site: The Homepage (index), About, Projects, and Contact Page

Animations:
On homepage, when you just open it, there is an SVG animation of my logo. Then the screen is "liftedup" and there is another animation with "Born to Innovate" being typed up. When you see this screen in mobile view, you can see the hamburger menu and see when you click on and see it being animated.

On the about page, there is an animation with my name. When you click on the contact page, there is a page tranisition.

On the project page, the "contact me!" link wobbles on the bottom. The project fades in. When you click on a project, it slides to the right. Then the project screens slides in.

On the contact page, there is an animation on the word "Let me know if you want to collaborate or connect!"
