                                There are so many different window blinds such as the traditional blinds or roller blinds with the fabric shades. I decided to focus on the traditional venetian style blinds that were most commonly found in households. 
                                <br><br>
                                Currently, there are two different ways to control the window blinds. 
                                <br><br>
                                1. The tilt wand changes the angle of the slats 
                                <br><br>
                                2. The lift cord raises the entire blind up and down

                                By redesigning the window blind control, it was easy for people to move up and down and open and close the blinds all in one control. When people are in a rush, they do not need to necessarily use their hands to physically pull down and close the blind. By using any part of the body to push the thumb wheel switch all the way down with enough force, it will also drag the slider down to make it easier to close all your blind at once. As opposed to the remote, people would not have to control the blinds through repetitive motion of continuioiously clicking on a button. This new control makes it easier to adjust the blind without dealing with repetitive motion of a button or the hassle of pulling on a cord or turning a rod. 

                                A. Percepetual Affordance: Having the finger impressions on the side, it provides the contact for the users to move it up and down. I think having the slider track, users can see that the slider can move up and down. Having the switch on the thumbwheel, people will want to move it up and down. 

                                B. Feedforward:The feedforward of the design is that the users can know at which level the blinds are at from the position it is on. 

                                C. Feedback: The feedback of the design is that they should be able to see the blinds move at the same time they move the design.
