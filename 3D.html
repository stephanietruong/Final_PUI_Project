                            <h6>BRAINSTORMING AND SKETCHING</h6>
                            <p>
                                I got inspired to make a glasses rack to hold my sunglasses. Right now, I just randomly place my sunglasses and sometimes I might lose them. So I wanted the sunglasses rack to help organize my sunglasses and prevent them from breaking or getting lost.
                                <br><br>
                                I made a standard rack that did not take up a lot of room. I first did a rough sketch and then I started using Fusion to create a model. However, it was not the best since I added the different parts at the wrong order and it made it more confusing. I did not know the exact measurement which made it hard to build in Fusion. As opposed to the previous project, the measurement here are important. I needed to create a rack where my sunglasses are about to fit on it. Therefore, I took a step back and started to sketch again. This time, it was with specific measurement.

                            <h6>PRINTING IN ZOLARIX AND NVBOTS</h6>
                            <p>
                                Due to the my file being too large, I was using the Zolartiz 3D printer instead. It was a similar process but I need to transfer my file via a memory card and manually tell the 3D printer to print.
                                <br><br>
                                I also broke down my piece into different parts that I can assemble together. I need to go back to Fusion to layout the pieces to so they can print next to each other. I started to print the base of the structure and the rectangular structure using the Zolartiz printer. It took 23 hours. However, my structure did not print all the way.
                                <br><br>
                                For my original piece, the rectangular part did not print all the way and the dimensions were exactly the same as a base so it did not fit into the bottom of the base. I tried sanding it down but then I realized that it will not help since i will have to sand off a lot. So I decided to reprint the parts.
                                <br><br>
                                The cable and extruder of the Zolarix printer was broken so I had to revert back to using NVBots. 
                                <br><br>
                                I was able to print my rectangular parts and a pair of the cylinder rods due to the time constraint. The cylinder rod in the front were a bit to long and I realized I did not need them that long. Therefore, I used a small saw to cut the rod in half. Then I glued together the pieces using acrylic glue.
